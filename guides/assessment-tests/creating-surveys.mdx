## What is a Survey?

Unlike tests, surveys do not have right or wrong answers. They are used to gather learners' opinions, feedback, and subjective responses about course content or any other topic.

## Survey Question Types

Surveys support all the same [question types as tests](/guides/assessment-tests/creating-questions), plus two additional types specifically designed for gathering feedback:

### Matrix Question

Matrix questions allow learners to rate multiple items using the same scale. This is ideal for collecting structured feedback on related topics.

**Features:**
- Add multiple rows (items to be rated)
- Define column headers (rating scale)
- Learners select one option per row
- Great for satisfaction surveys and evaluations

### Essay Question

Essay questions provide learners with a text area to write detailed, free-form responses.

**Use cases:**
- Open-ended feedback
- Detailed opinions or suggestions
- Reflection exercises
- Course improvement ideas

## How Surveys Look to Learners

When learners take a survey, they see a clean interface that makes it easy to provide their feedback.

<Note>
Surveys do not show scores or correct/incorrect indicators since there are no right answers.
</Note>

## Making Questions Mandatory

You can make specific survey questions required to ensure you collect all the feedback you need.

**How to make a question mandatory:**
1. Select the question in your survey
2. Check the **"Mandatory"** option in question settings
3. Learners cannot submit the survey without answering mandatory questions

<Tip>
Use mandatory questions strategically. Too many required questions may discourage completion.

- **Mix question types**: Combine scales, multiple choice, and essays for comprehensive feedback
- **Make it anonymous**: Consider whether you need to track individual responses
- **Test before deploying**: Preview your survey from the learner's perspective
