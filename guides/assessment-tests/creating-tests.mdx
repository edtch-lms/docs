## Creating Tests

Tests are one of the building blocks of your courses. Use them to ask the learner a number of questions to assess their understanding of the course material. Tests can be used in both simple and extended mode.

To add a test to a course, open the course for editing (unpublish it if necessary), then drag and drop the **Test** element from the toolbar on the left to the Story Map. Once you have added the test to the Story Map, open it for editing to fill it with questions.

## Question Types

There are six question types you can use:

- "Yes/No" question
- Multiple choice question
- Sorting question
- Matching question
- Text reply question
- Text gap question

To add a question, drag and drop the corresponding element from the toolbar on the left to the desired position within the test. This will open the configuration window that enables you to construct your question.

Once a question has been added, you can change its position within the test, or delete it.

To change the position of a question within a test, click and hold the icon, then drag the question up or down to the desired position. To delete a question, click the icon.

## Assigning Tags

You can assign one or more tags to each question within a test. The percentage of correctly answered questions with each tag is tracked in statistics. You can, for example, tag all questions concerning a particular topic with a unique tag, then track what percentage of questions with a given tag is answered correctly. If questions with a particular tag demonstrate a consistently low rate of correct answers, it may indicate that the material is too hard, poorly explained, or that the questions are constructed incorrectly.

To assign tags to a question, open the question for editing, type the tag name in the **Tags** field, then press the Enter key. You can assign multiple tags to a single question.

To remove a tag from a question, open the question for editing, locate the tag you want to remove, and click the icon next to the tag's name.

## Question Pools

It's a wise decision to reuse questions you once created. There are several scenarios when you can benefit from question pools:

- **Make a final test** that checks knowledge across several courses. In such case you simply pull few questions from each intermediate test and add those to the final assessment.

- **Make an updated version** of existing assessment. When a new process, product or a product version is out you may want to do a refresher on topics that you've covered in previous courses. That's where you can copy old assessments and adjust those to suit new circumstances.

- **Slightly change assessment** for another audience (e.g. add simple technical questions from technical training to sales onboarding training).

### How to Copy Questions

Here is how you copy questions from existing tests:

1. Create new test
2. Click **copy from existing tests** on the question list panel or the **Import** icon on the left bar:

3. In the pop-up search for the title of the test that contains questions you want to copy
4. Choose the corresponding course and test
5. Select questions you want to add to your new test:

6. Click **Copy**

<Note>
You can select same question for copying several times and even copy questions from the test you are editing at the moment. The system will add new copies of these questions to the end of the list.
</Note>

### Creating Question Variations

If you want to present different set of questions for different learners or even for different attempts, use these hints:

1. Create excessive amount of questions by copying and slightly modifying basic set of questions

2. Specify the number of questions to show during each attempt in test settings:

</Frame>

<Tip>
- For small tests with 10 questions or less there has to be 2-3 times more questions in the pool to reduce probability of cheating.
- For bigger tests it is sufficient to add 30-50% more questions, together with randomization it will do the trick.
</Tip>

3. Enable **Shuffle questions** option

## Configuring Test Settings

To configure the settings of the test, click the settings icon.

</Frame>

This enables you to do the following:

- **Type in a title and description** for the test. Both the title and the description are visible to learners who are about to take the test.

- **Specify the maximum number of attempts**. Learners who make the specified number of attempts and still fail to pass the test will be unable to take the test again.

- **Specify a time limit**. Learners who take longer than the specified amount of time to finish the test will have all unanswered questions marked as answered incorrectly.

- **Enable question shuffling**. This option makes it so that the questions within the test are presented in a random order.

- **Forbid skipping questions**. By default, learners can skip questions without answering them. Enabling this option will make it so that learners have to answer a question before seeing the next one.

- **Specify the number of questions** to show during each attempt in test settings

- **Set the pass threshold**. This value determines the percentage of questions in the test (from 0% to 100%) a learner has to answer correctly to pass the test.

Once you have finished configuring the settings, click **Save Changes** to close the settings menu.

## Previewing, Saving, and Exiting

When you have finished editing the test, it is time to see how it would look in the course.

To preview the test, click the preview icon.

If you are satisfied with the test, it is time to exit the test editor.

To exit the test editor and return to the course builder, click the exit icon.

All changes you made to the test will be saved automatically.
