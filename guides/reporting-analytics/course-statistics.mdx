In this field, you will find indicators such as:

- Number of users assigned to the course
- Number of users in the process of taking the course
- Total number of course completion attempts by all assigned users
- Average score across all completions

<Tip>
The average score can help you, as the course author, draw conclusions about the difficulty or quality of the course. For example, if most users are struggling with the course, consider making changes to the course structure or content.
