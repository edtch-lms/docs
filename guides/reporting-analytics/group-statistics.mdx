## Accessing Group Statistics

The statistics tab allows you to track the performance of group members in various categories.

## Overall Group Statistics

First, you will see the overall statistics for the group, where group members are divided into 5 categories:

### Leaders
**Marked with a green dot** - Members who have completed most of their assigned courses and have achieved above-average results on average.

### Achievers
**Marked with a blue dot** - Members who have completed a small number of their assigned courses and have achieved above-average results on average.

### Laggers
**Marked with a red dot** - Members who have completed most of their assigned courses and have achieved below-average results.

### Beginners
**Marked with a yellow dot** - Members who have completed a small number of their assigned courses and have achieved below-average results.

### Inactive
Members who have not completed any courses.

## Leaderboard Table

Below in the Leaderboard Table, you can visually compare all group members based on **"number of completed courses"** and **"average result"** indicators. Users will be marked with a dot of the corresponding color in the table.

<Tip>
Hovering over the dot will display the names of users with the same average result and number of completed courses.

## Group Results

In the **"Group Results"** field, you can select the time interval you are interested in to view:
- Number of courses assigned to members
- Number of courses they have completed

## Users Without Results

The **"Users Without Results"** field reflects group members who have started at least one course assigned to the group but have not yet completed any course.

## Inactive Users

The **"Inactive Users"** field provides a list of group members who have not started any courses assigned to the group.

## Group Hierarchy

For easier navigation through groups, use the group hierarchy, which operates like a nesting doll: one large group can contain several smaller groups, each of which may also include some subgroups, and so on.

### Creating Groups with Hierarchy

To create a new group:

1. Click the **"+"** button
2. Enter the group's name
3. If this group will be the main group, do not specify a **"Parent Group"**
4. If this group will be part of a larger group, enter its name in the **"Parent Group"** field

<Note>
These settings can be changed at any time in the group settings.

## Best Practices

- **Identify at-risk learners**: Focus on Laggers and Beginners who may need additional support
- **Recognize high performers**: Acknowledge Leaders and Achievers to maintain motivation
- **Address inactive members**: Reach out to inactive users to understand barriers to engagement
- **Use time intervals**: Compare group performance across different time periods to track trends
- **Leverage hierarchy**: Organize groups logically to make reporting and management easier
- **Set group goals**: Establish target completion rates and average scores for groups
- **Compare groups**: Use similar metrics across groups to identify best practices
