- **Act on insights**: Use data to improve courses and support learners
- **Export strategically**: Download data for board meetings or compliance reports
- **Focus on outliers**: Pay attention to unusually high or low performance
- **Balance metrics**: Don't rely solely on scores; consider engagement and completion rates

## Getting Started

1. Start with **Course Statistics** to understand individual course performance
2. Review **Group Statistics** to identify team trends
3. Check **User Statistics** for learners who need support

5. Export data regularly for record-keeping and deeper analysis

<Tip>
Combine multiple statistics views to get a complete picture. For example, if course statistics show low average scores, check user statistics to see if specific learners need help, or review group statistics to identify team-wide training gaps.
