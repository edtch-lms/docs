The overall statistics field shows:

- Number of courses published in the system
- Number of active users in the system
- Number of user groups

## Leaders

In the leaderboard table, users (or groups of users) are represented with dots, indicating their results in terms of the number of completed courses compared to the average result for completed courses.

This visualization helps identify:
- Top performers across the entire platform
- Users or groups that need support
- Overall engagement patterns

## Courses

The graph displays the number of courses created, published, and assigned.

- **X-axis**: Time points, which can be adjusted depending on the selected period
- **Y-axis**: Number of courses

This helps track:
- Course creation velocity
- Publication trends
- Assignment patterns over time

## Users Without Results

This field provides a list of all system users who have started at least one of the courses assigned to them but have not yet completed any.

<Warning>
This metric can indicate:
- Courses that are too difficult or time-consuming
- Users who may need additional support
- Technical or accessibility issues preventing completion
</Warning>

## Inactive Users

This list includes system users who have not yet started any of the courses assigned to them.

**Common reasons for inactivity:**
- Users haven't received or seen course notifications
- Courses assigned don't align with user needs or interests
- Technical barriers preventing access
- Lack of time or motivation

## Unassigned Courses

This is a list of published courses for which assignments have not yet been made.

<Tip>
Regularly review this list to ensure valuable content is being utilized. Published courses with no assignments may represent missed training opportunities.
</Tip>

## User Filtering

To find users more quickly, you can customize filters in the **"Users"** and **"Groups"** tabs of the **"Team"** section in the sidebar menu.

**For user filtering**, you can use filters based on:
- Roles
- Registration dates in the system

**For group filtering**, you can use a filter based on:
- Number of users

## Best Practices

- **Monitor platform health**: Regularly review global statistics to understand overall system usage
- **Identify system-wide trends**: Use course creation and assignment graphs to spot patterns
- **Address inactive users**: Develop strategies to engage users who haven't started courses
- **Optimize course assignments**: Review unassigned courses and assign them to relevant users/groups
- **Benchmark performance**: Use leaders data to set realistic performance expectations
- **Export and analyze**: Download CSV files for deeper analysis in external tools
- **Set platform goals**: Establish targets for course completion rates, active users, and engagement
- **Compare time periods**: Track how metrics change over weeks, months, or quarters
- **Use filters effectively**: Leverage filtering to quickly identify specific user segments
