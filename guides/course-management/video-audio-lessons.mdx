## Video/Audio Lessons

To make your courses accessible for the greatest number of people, now you can supply video with subtitles, narrate your slides with audio, enhance the recorded lecture with high-resolution slide deck available along the footage.

There is no secret that all learners consume information in their specific ways. Visual learners prefer schemes and graphics; audial learners better operate with textual and audio information. Some learners may have situations when listening to audio or distinguishing small pictures is challenging, and they need to have their workarounds too.

## How do I create video lectures in Konstantly?

Open an existing course which you'd like to add a video lecture to (or just create a new one).

Drag and drop **Lesson** course element to the Course Builder, you'll need it to create your video lecture.

You can add audio or video track and synchronize it with the playback of the lesson clicking **"Video"** button on the toolbar on the left.

Choose the video/audio file* to upload from your hard drive or use a YouTube search function.

The file you choose appears in the lower left corner.

<Note>
**Compatible formats:** MPEG, MP4, WEBM, MP3, OGG, AAC. File size is limited by 4GB
</Note>

## Working with the Timeline

At the bottom of the screen there is a timeline which represents the video/audio file you've chosen.

After file is uploaded, system evenly places all the pages on the timeline. You can scale the timeline to see the sequence of pages and the time period when they are shown.

Using our new functionality you can bind the pages to the timecode. This way you can precisely synchronize visual content and narration.

### Adjusting Page Timing

To set the exact time for the page to be shown, just drag and drop its icon to the left or to the right on the timeline.

Click the '▶' button to preview your lecture and make sure that the content of the page is synchronized with the narration in the chosen period.

## Video Frame Settings

In the middle part of the screen you can set position and size of the video/audio frame to correspond the design and content of each page in the lesson.

Using the Settings you can give your learners the permission to rewind or fast-forward the content and also turn on the autoplay function.

## How does the learner see it?

- If the **Autoplay** function is enabled, the playback and page-turning are performed automatically, without involving the learner.

- If the **Fast-forwarding** is allowed, learners can directly go to the page they like. If some pages are skipped the lecture is played from the moment which is pinned to the chosen page.
