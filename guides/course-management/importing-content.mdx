## Importing Content

When building courses in Konstantly, besides creating course elements from scratch, you can import content from other popular course-building solutions. At the present moment, you can import content in the following formats:

- **SCORM**
- **PDF**
- **PPTX**

Data in the input files is parsed and separated into individual objects on different layers, such as images, videos, objects, and text.

<Note>
Although we try to make the imported course objects look the same as the originals, a 100% match cannot be guaranteed. In addition, at the present moment all images are merged into the page background and cannot be edited individually.
</Note>

## PowerPoint Picture Presentation Format

If you'd like to have your imported PowerPoint file non-editable in the system, but looking just like the original, please follow the instructions below:

1. Open your PowerPoint file
2. Go to **File** → **Export** → **Change File Type**
3. You will see a window like the one in the picture below
4. Among "Presentation file types" choose the lowest one in the right column - **"PowerPoint Picture Presentation"**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/course-management/ppt-export.png" alt="PowerPoint export options showing Picture Presentation format" />
</Frame>

5. Import this new file to your course

## How to Import

To import content, open the course for editing (unpublish it if necessary), then drag and drop the **Import** element from the toolbar on the left to the Story Map. Browse to the file you want to import, then click **Open**. Once the import procedure has finished, you will be able to view and edit the imported content.

<Info>
Importing content can take up to a few minutes, depending on the size of the file and the number of objects being imported.
