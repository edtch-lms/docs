## Course Overview

Being an Administrator allows you to see all the courses present on your Konstantly site both 'Published' and 'Drafts'.

Drafts are sorted by date – from the newest on top to earlier created on the bottom.

Published courses are sorted by the publishing date and time.

## Creating a New Course

To create a new course open the 'Courses' tab and click '+Create' in the upper right corner. The dropdown menu will ask whether you would like to create or import. Choosing import, be aware that you can upload only previously exported Konstantly courses saved in a zip file.

When choosing 'Create', fill in the fields "Name", "Annotation", upload a cover picture and press 'Create' at the bottom of the page.

<Note>
By doing this, a landing page and a draft of a course will be created and course builder will be opened automatically.
</Note>

## Landing Page

Landing page contains all the information about the course, so make sure to fill here all the important information. In the list of courses learners will only see the cover, the name and the annotation, so it shouldn't be long, but in one sentence should give an idea what the course is about.

Course description can be longer, so don't forget to mention the approximate duration of the course, the names of authors, materials used and additional materials that can be helpful during or after the course. You can edit all of these fields by pressing the icon at the top of the page and then Edit.

On this page you may also attach documents, images, videos and any other types of files related to the course for the assigned learners to download. Simply click in the same dropdown menu.

## Course Actions

As for the other options in the menu, they will allow you:

- **Copy** – a copy of this course will be created available for editing. The course will appear on the top in the drafts list with the name "Copy. –Name_of_the_course-"

- **Export** – the course will be downloaded to your computer as a zip file. It can be imported back to this or another Konstantly site only

- **Delete** – this option is available for the draft courses only, you will need to unpublish the course in order to delete it. Deleting will erase all the statistics regarding this course from users', groups' and site's statistics
