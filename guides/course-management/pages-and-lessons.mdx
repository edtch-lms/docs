## Pages vs Lessons

Pages and Lessons are the cornerstone of every course. They may seem similar, but they have their differences.

Think of **Lesson** as a PowerPoint file – create multiple slides inside to deliver all the theoretical information to your learners. When at this element, a learner can go back and forth through the slides before proceeding to the next element connected by the default arrow. Lesson is keeping the whole sequence of pages in one element so it will keep it nice and tidy on the course map.

**Page** element, obviously, is a single standing page and is best used for the purposes of navigation between parts of the course like a menu, for the welcoming and goodbye pages in a course, for pages like "you have failed the test" and "you have passed the test".

Page is the only element in the system that can have outgoing click transition connections.

To add a new element, choose one from the list on the left side, then drag and drop it to the map of the course. When you see the element is on the map, double click it to open and start working on its content.

## Tools for Pages and Lessons

To add an object, be it text, image, video, iframe, or a shape, drag and drop the corresponding element from the toolbar on the left to the page.

<Note>
Objects placed outside the grid may not be displayed on the page when a learner takes the course.
</Note>

Images, text frames, shapes and videos on the Page can become clickable buttons when you set them as target objects to a click transition.

### Text

You can use all the expected word processor features such as styles, font sizes, etc to add text to your page and customize it.

**Click a text object once** to customize it. This enables you to do the following:

- Click the icon to increase the size of the selected object so that either its height fits the height of the page, or that its width fits the width of the page. Note that the ratio between the object's width and height remains constant.
- Click the icon to copy the selected object. A copy of the object is created on a separate layer. Layers are explained further in this article.
- Click the icon to delete the selected object.

You can also do the following:

- Set the opacity of the text, from 100% to 0%.
- Add a border to the selected object. You can choose to make the border either solid or dotted line, and set the border's thickness and color.

**Click a text object twice** to type in and edit the text. Besides, this enables you to do the following:

- Click the icon to make it so that the selected object fits the width of the page.
- Click the icon to copy the selected object. A copy of the object is created on a separate layer. Layers are explained further in this article.
- Click the icon to delete the selected object.

You can also do the following:

- Apply either the "heading" or "normal" preset to the text. This changes the font, the size, and the color of the text depending on the selected color scheme.
- Set the size of the text.
- Apply styles, such as bold, underscore, and italic.
- Set the text alignment.
- Define the text color.
- Add a bullet or numbered list.

Once you have finished customizing your text, click anywhere on the screen to close the customization menu.

### Image

You can upload image files, use in-built Google safe search or use URLs of images hosted elsewhere to add images to your page. Edit all images right here in the system without using external tools – change the size, crop, add frame, make transparent.

</Frame>

**Click an image object** to customize it. This enables you to do the following:

- Click the icon to increase the size of the selected object so that either its height fits the height of the page, or that its width fits the width of the page. Note that the ratio between the object's width and height remains constant.
- Click the icon to copy the selected object. A copy of the object is created on a separate layer. Layers are explained further in this article.
- Click the icon to delete the selected object.

You can also do the following:

- Upload an image from your computer or device.
- Use Google to search for an image hosted elsewhere and use it.
- See the list of recently used images and pick one from the list to use.
- Set the opacity of the selected object, from 100% to 0%.
- Add a border to the selected object. You can choose to make the border either a solid or a dotted line, and set the border's thickness and color.

Once you have finished customizing your image, click anywhere on the screen to close the customization menu.

### Video

You can upload video files, use in-built YouTube search or use URLs of videos hosted elsewhere to add videos to your page. Same as images, videos can be edited in the system as well: choose the interval in the video to only play a part of it on the page, set up autoplay. Your learners (in the player mode) will be able to adjust the playback speed to the comfortable pace.

Once you have finished customizing your shape, click anywhere on the screen to close the customization menu.

### Iframe

You can specify an URL to add embedded content to your page. Any content that you find on the web with the "share iframe" standing under it can become a part of your course.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/course-management/iframe.gif" alt="Embedding iframe content" />
</Frame>

**Click an iframe object** to customize it. This enables you to do the following:

- Add a border to the embedded object. You can choose to make the border either solid or dotted line, and set the border's thickness and color.

Once you have finished customizing your iframe, click anywhere on the screen to close the customization menu.

## Using Templates

Pages can be designed from scratch, or you can use one of the pre-configured templates to create the basic layout. Page templates contain placeholder images and fragments of text that you can replace with actual text and images.

To create a page using a template, click the icon found in the upper right corner of the screen, select the desired template, and click Apply. Once the template has been applied, you can edit the placeholder objects according to the steps described further in this topic.

<Note>
Applying a template to a page will remove all objects present on the page.
</Note>

## Layers

Every object on the page exists on a separate layer. This comes into effect to determine what object is displayed on top when two or more objects overlap. To see all the layers, click the icon.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/course-management/layers.gif" alt="Managing layers" />
</Frame>

Mouse over a layer to bring up the instruments that enable you to do the following:

- Click the icon or the icon to move the layer up or down the list. Objects on layers higher on the list are displayed on top of objects on layers lower on the list when two or more objects overlap.
- Click the icon to customize the object on the layer.
- Click the icon to delete both the layer and the associated object.

When you have finished working with the layers, click anywhere on the screen to close the layers menu.

## Managing Objects

Once an object has been added, you can relocate it, resize it, rotate it, and customize it.

**To relocate an object**, drag and drop it to the desired location on the page. You have two tools that help you to position objects with respect to each other:

- **The grid**: Align objects using the grid as a reference. If you move the horizontal or the vertical edge of an object close to one of the grid lines, the object will "stick" to it. This makes it easier to move the object along one of the axes without shifting its position along the other.

- **Alignment lines**: Alignment lines appear when you move an object in such a manner that either its center aligns with the grid (either vertically or horizontally), or one of its edges aligns with the edge of a different object. This helps you align objects against the grid and each other.

**To resize an object**, click it, and then click one of the four corners of the object and drag them. Note that the ratio between the object's width and height remains constant. If the selected object is a text, you can also click the arrow icon on its right side to make the text object wider or more narrow.

**To rotate an object**, click it, and then click the rhombus icon connected to the object's bottom right corner and rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise.

**To customize an object**, click it. The available customization options depend on the type of the object.

## Customizing the Background

To add a custom background to your page, click one of the icons in the top right corner of the page:

- Click the icon to fill the background with a single color.
- Click the icon to either upload an image from your computer or device, or to use Google to search for an image hosted elsewhere, and use it as the background.

## Choosing the Color Scheme and Typography

Your page can be customized further with an alternative color scheme and typography.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/course-management/themes.gif" alt="Choosing color schemes and typography" />
</Frame>

To choose a different color scheme, click the icon, then click the name of the currently selected color scheme. Select a new one from the menu, then click anywhere on the screen to close the customization menu.

To change the typography, click the icon, then click the name of the currently selected typography. Select a new one from the menu, then click anywhere on the screen to close the customization menu.

<Note>
The font at the top will be used for text with the "heading" preset applied, and the font at the bottom will be used for text with the "normal" preset.
</Note>

## Previewing, Saving, and Exiting

When you have finished editing the page, it is time to see how it would look in the course.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/course-management/play.gif" alt="Preview mode" />
