## Overview

In order to manage Konstantly effectively, it's necessary to create separate Konstantly accounts for each learner. This allows you to assign courses to them and track their progress. Moreover, you may also need to establish accounts for staff members who will aid in platform management, as well as for course authors responsible for course creation.

However, it's crucial to ensure that the users you create are granted specific access privileges within Konstantly. For instance, you may want learners to take tests and view their Reports and Statistics, while preventing them from altering courses or creating additional user accounts. Konstantly provides the means to accomplish this through role assignments.

## Accessing Role Management

To view the current list of configured user roles, simply navigate to the **"Settings"** tab and click on **"Role Management"**.

## Pre-configured Roles

Each role in Konstantly comes with a set of predefined privileges, determining the extent of functionality available to users within that role. Here are three pre-configured roles that you can assign to a Konstantly user:

### Administrator

Konstantly administrators enjoy full access to all platform functionalities. They can add or remove users and groups, create and edit courses, adjust Konstantly settings, and more.

**Key privileges:**
- Full access to all features
- User and group management
- Course creation and editing
- Platform settings configuration
- All reporting and analytics

### Manager

Managers have access to most of the functionalities available to administrators, with a few exceptions. For instance, they cannot edit user accounts of administrators and other managers.

**Key privileges:**
- Course creation and editing
- Assign courses to users
- View reports and statistics
- Manage learner accounts
- Limited user management (cannot edit administrators or other managers)

### Learner

Learner accounts have the fewest privileges. Learners can edit their personal information and take courses assigned to them by a manager or an administrator.

**Key privileges:**
- Take assigned courses
- View personal progress
- Edit personal profile
- View Reports and Statistics (if enabled)
- No administrative access

## Creating Custom Roles

If your license permits, you can also create custom user roles by mixing and matching various privileges to precisely tailor the level of access for specific users or user groups to different Konstantly features.

### Editing User Roles

All user roles, except for the **Administrator** role, are editable and can be removed. Removal of a user role is only possible when there is no user assigned to that role. Additionally, it is possible to quickly create a different user role based on an existing one.

**To make edits to a user role:**

1. Hover your mouse pointer over the role you want to edit
2. Click on the role to open the privilege editor
3. Review the list of privileges available
4. Select checkboxes to grant privileges
5. Clear checkboxes to revoke privileges
6. Hover over the "i" symbol next to any privilege to learn more about it

<Warning>
Certain privileges can only be granted if another specific privilege has already been granted. For instance, you cannot assign the 'Assign courses to users' privilege without first granting the 'View users' privilege.
</Warning>

### Privilege Dependencies

When configuring custom roles, be aware that some privileges have dependencies:

- **Assign courses to users** requires **View users**
- **Edit courses** may require **View courses**
- **Manage groups** may require **View groups**

The system will indicate these dependencies when you attempt to configure privileges.

## Best Practices

- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant users only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their duties
- **Regular audits**: Periodically review user roles to ensure they still align with job responsibilities
- **Role naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for custom roles (e.g., "Content Creator", "Course Reviewer")
- **Test new roles**: Create a test account to verify that custom roles have the correct permissions before assigning them broadly
- **Document custom roles**: Maintain documentation about what each custom role can and cannot do
- **Separate responsibilities**: Don't give all users administrative access; create specific roles for specific tasks
- **Monitor role usage**: Track which roles are actively used and retire unused custom roles
- **Protect Administrator role**: Limit the number of users with Administrator privileges to maintain security
