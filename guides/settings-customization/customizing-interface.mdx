## Branding Overview

To create a more welcoming environment for learners and strengthen your brand identity, you have the option to personalize the Konstantly interface to match your organization's image. This includes the ability to replace the standard Konstantly logo and background image with custom alternatives.

Additionally, for more extensive customization, feel free to inform us of your specific requirements, such as a custom domain name, favicon, tagline, title, and more, and we'll accommodate your requests.

## Accessing Branding Settings

To change the branding, open the **"Settings"** tab, and click **"Branding"**. Both the logo and the background image can be changed here.

## Customizable Elements

### Logo for Sidebar, Login Page, and Email

To change the logo, click **Upload** in the **"Upload your own logo"** section and select the image file containing the custom logo.

</Frame>

**Logo Requirements:**
- File format: PNG with transparent background
- Maximum dimensions: 100×60 pixels
- Works in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Avoid white colors (logo displays on white background)
- Use brighter colors for better visibility

<Warning>
If the logo hasn't updated after upload, ensure the image meets the required specifications: no larger than 100×60 pixels with a transparent background.
</Warning>

<Note>
The logo is presented in both vertical and horizontal orientations on various screens, so it's important to ensure it appears appealing in both portrait and landscape modes.
</Note>

### Controls

Personalize the color scheme of control elements by selecting from the available options or entering the code for your corporate color from the palette. The button will be filled with the selected primary color, and the text or shape within it will take on the secondary color.

**Color Customization:**
- **Primary color**: Fills the button background
- **Secondary color**: Applies to text or shapes within buttons
- Choose from preset options or enter custom hex codes
- Use corporate colors to maintain brand consistency

### Background for the Login Page

To modify the background, simply click on **"Change image"** within the **"Set custom background for the login page"** section and choose the image file that contains your custom background.

<Tip>
If the image you're uploading happens to be particularly large, don't worry if the background momentarily turns white. The new background will be applied as soon as the file finishes loading.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- **Consistent branding**: Use the same logo and color scheme across all your learning materials
- **Test visibility**: Ensure your logo is clearly visible in both sidebar and login page contexts
- **High-quality images**: Use high-resolution images for backgrounds to maintain professional appearance
- **Color contrast**: Choose primary and secondary colors that provide good contrast for readability
- **Brand guidelines**: Follow your organization's brand guidelines for colors, logos, and visual elements
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Consider how your branding appears on different screen sizes
- **File optimization**: Compress large background images to improve loading times
