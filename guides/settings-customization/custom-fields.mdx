Here you will need to specify the following parameters:

- **Custom field type**: The way the custom field will be displayed on user and group profile pages
- **API ID**: Unique identifier of the field that will be used for manipulating this field via API
- **Field name**: The way the field will be labelled on user and group profile pages

<Note>

Each custom field has additional settings:

### Show on Profile Page

When enabled, the value is displayed on user's and group's profile page and is visible by everyone who has permission to view the object.

### Allow Users to Set Field Values

When enabled, the value is editable by a user for their own profile page.

### Make Field Mandatory

When enabled, the field gets mandatory to fill in when editing profile page. It also automatically enables the previous two options.

<Tip>
Custom fields are displayed on profile page in the exact same order as you specify in site settings. To reorder custom fields, simply drag and drop the set in the way you want.
</Tip>

## Permissions

A user should have **Manage custom fields** permission in order to be able to create and modify set of custom fields for users and groups:
