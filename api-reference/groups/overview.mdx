# Groups

The Groups API allows you to manage groups of users in your Konstantly site. Groups make it easier to organize users and assign courses to multiple users at once.

## Common Use Cases

### Organizing Users
Groups help organize users based on departments, teams, locations, or any other organizational structure. You can create nested groups by setting a parent group ID.

### Bulk Course Assignment
Instead of assigning courses to users individually, you can assign courses to groups. All users in the group will automatically get access to the assigned courses.

### Reporting
Get statistics and progress reports for entire groups of users, making it easier to track team performance and course completion rates.

## Best Practices

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Use the parentId field to create a logical hierarchy of groups that matches your organization's structure.

2. **Naming Convention**: Adopt a consistent naming convention for groups to make them easy to identify and manage.

3. **Custom Attributes**: Use custom attributes to store additional group metadata that's specific to your organization's needs.

4. **Group Size**: While there's no strict limit on group size, consider breaking very large groups into smaller subgroups for better management and performance.
