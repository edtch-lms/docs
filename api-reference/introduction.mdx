# Konstantly API Documentation

**Attention:** This is a beta version of API documentation that may contain inaccuracies.
Report errors to [support@konstantly.com](mailto:support@konstantly.com)

## <Icon icon="info-circle" /> Overview

The Konstantly API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## <Icon icon="globe" /> Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://YOURSITE.konstant.ly/openapi/v1
```

## <Icon icon="key" /> Authentication

The Konstantly API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can get your API key from:

1. Go to your Konstantly site

2. Navigate to Settings > API

3. Copy your API key

All API requests must include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header:

```bash
X-API-KEY: 1qaz2wsx3edc4rfv1qaz2wsx3edc4rfv
```

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure and never share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.
</Note>

## <Icon icon="file-code" /> Request Format

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. All requests should include the following headers:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

## <Icon icon="list" /> Pagination

Many endpoints return paginated results. By default, endpoints return 20 items per page. You can specify which page of results to return using the `offset` parameter:

<ParamField query="offset" type="integer">
  The number of items to skip. Use this for pagination.
</ParamField>
