## Course Assignment States

A course assignment can be in various states:

- **Not Started**: `isCourseStarted: false`
- **In Progress**: `isCourseStarted: true` and `isCourseFinished: false`
- **Completed**: `isCourseFinished: true`
- **Expired**: `isExpired: true`

## Progress and Results

The assignment tracks two key metrics:

- **Progress** (`progressValue`): Indicates how much of the course content the user has completed, ranging from 0 to 100.
- **Result** (`resultValue`): Represents the user's performance or score in the course, ranging from 0 to 100.

Progress and result values are independent - a user might have high progress (completed most of the course) but a low result score (poor performance on assessments), or vice versa.
