# Delete Resources

This guide covers how to delete different resources using DELETE endpoints.

## Delete User

Delete a user account. Note that users must be blocked before they can be deleted.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Request
    curl -X DELETE "https://YOURSITE.konstant.ly/openapi/v1/users/1234567890" \
    -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    ```json 200 Success
    {}
    ```

    ```json 422 Error - User Not Blocked
    {
        "status": 422,
        "message": "You should block users before deleting them"
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Delete Group

Delete a group. This will not delete the users in the group.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Request
    curl -X DELETE "https://YOURSITE.konstant.ly/openapi/v1/groups/123" \
    -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"

## Error Responses

<ResponseExample>
    ```json 404 Not Found
    {
        "status": 404,
        "message": "Resource not found"
    }
    ```

    ```json 422 Unprocessable Entity
    {
        "status": 422,
        "message": "Cannot perform operation",
        "data": {
        "reason": "Dependency exists"
    }
    }
    ```
</ResponseExample>

## Best Practices

1. Always confirm deletions with the user before making DELETE requests
2. Handle 404 errors gracefully if the resource doesn't exist
3. Check for dependencies before deleting resources
4. Consider soft deletes for critical data
5. Maintain audit logs of deletion operations

<Note>
    Deleted resources cannot be recovered. Make sure to back up any important data before deletion.
