  - `weeks`
  - `months`
</ResponseField>

# Percent Statistics

The percent statistics type represents a distribution of values across percentage ranges. Each key represents a percentage range, and its value represents the count of items in that range.

## Format

- Single percentages are represented as strings: `"0"` and `"100"`
- Ranges are represented as strings with the format: `"[min]-[max]"`
- Values are integers representing the count in each range

## Ranges

- `"0"`: Exactly 0%
- `"1-10"`: 1% to 10%
- `"11-20"`: 11% to 20%
- `"21-30"`: 21% to 30%
- `"31-40"`: 31% to 40%
- `"41-50"`: 41% to 50%
- `"51-60"`: 51% to 60%
- `"61-70"`: 61% to 70%
- `"71-80"`: 71% to 80%
- `"81-90"`: 81% to 90%
- `"91-99"`: 91% to 99%
- `"100"`: Exactly 100%

## Example

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "0": 2,
  "1-10": 1,
  "11-20": 3,
  "21-30": 9,
  "31-40": 0,
  "41-50": 4,
  "51-60": 3,
  "61-70": 5,
  "71-80": 7,
  "81-90": 4,
  "91-99": 3,
  "100": 2
