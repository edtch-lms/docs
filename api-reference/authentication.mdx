The Konstantly API uses API keys for authentication. You need to include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header with every request.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Go to your Konstantly site's Settings
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Copy your API key

## Using the API Key

Include the API key in the `X-API-KEY` header with all requests:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" https://YOURSITE.konstant.ly/openapi/v1/courses
```

## API Key Security

<Warning>
    Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. The API key provides full access to your account.
</Warning>
