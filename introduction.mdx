# Konstantly API

Welcome to the Konstantly API documentation. This API allows you to programmatically manage users, courses, groups, certificates, and more in your Konstantly learning management platform.

<Note>
  This is a beta version of the API documentation. Report any errors to [support@konstantly.com](mailto:support@konstantly.com)
</Note>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://YOURSITE.konstant.ly/openapi/v1
```

Replace `YOURSITE` with your Konstantly subdomain.

## Authentication

The Konstantly API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header:

```bash
X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here
```

To get your API key:
1. Go to your Konstantly site
2. Navigate to **Settings > API**
3. Copy your API key

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code.
</Warning>

## Request Format

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. Include these headers:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

## Pagination

Many endpoints return paginated results. By default, endpoints return 20 items per page. Use the `offset` parameter to paginate:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `offset` | integer | Number of items to skip |
