### What's in Beta Right Now

**<Icon icon="wand-magic-sparkles" iconType="solid" size={16} /> AI-First Course Authoring**

AI is now part of the authoring workflow, helping you create courses instantly. The new AI Canvas Agent lives inside the editor with a chat panel on the right. You can describe what you need, such as a lesson outline, a diagram, or a branching flow, and the agent creates or adjusts it on the canvas in real time. It can also update text, colors, and positions, organize layouts, and even zoom or pan to focus on the right area.

**<Icon icon="paintbrush" iconType="solid" size={16} /> Smarter, Friendlier Course Builder**

We have re-imagined the course editor as a vibrant, flexible space built on the tldraw canvas. You can start with a quick linear flow where AI drafts a clean, ready-to-use structure, or switch to the Visual Pathboard to drag, connect, and design however you like. The new Pathboard 2.0 adds eleven element types, smart auto-routing for cleaner connections, a validation panel to catch issues before publishing, and import nodes with progress tracking. Course building is not just faster, it's more intuitive and even fun.

**<Icon icon="circle-play" iconType="solid" size={16} /> Upgraded Course Player**

The course player has been rebuilt for consistency and speed. It now unifies playback modes, supports screenshot-first loading for quicker previews, and renders content seamlessly. Learners benefit from a smoother experience with nine supported question types and built-in SCORM, PDF, and PPT import.

**<Icon icon="users-gear" iconType="solid" size={16} /> Team Operations and Permissions**

Team management has been modernized with a cleaner UI, global search, and bulk actions for managing users and groups. Role-aware controls remain fully compatible with Konstantly 1.0, ensuring that existing permissions and access levels continue to work without disruption.

**<Icon icon="compass" iconType="solid" size={16} /> What's Next**

We're preparing production-grade authentication and real-time multi-cursor collaboration. Coming soon are embedded learner whiteboards, deeper Zapier automation, and richer analytics. We're also refining the toolbar, expanding media provider integrations, adding certification templates, and completing full reporting parity.
